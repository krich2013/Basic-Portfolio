                        <p>A creative thinking, business savvy, technology enthusiast, I have successfully launched many products, evidence of which can be found in my products' WSJ features or in the significant revenue growth my products have generated. By championing human-centric approaches to identifying and solving the toughest technology problems, I have helped many organizations across the entire healthcare value chain conceptualize, prototype, and market test multiple new product ideas. </p>

                        <p>In my free time, I can be found doing long trail runs in the mountains of Colorado or skiing in the winter.  My puppy is my partner in crime, and he accompanies me to work in exchange for fetch time at the park. </p>
